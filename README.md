# iam-notebooks

These Jupyter notebooks serve both as exercises and teaching materials for the course "Introduction to Atomistic Modeling", given as part of the BSc in Materials Science at EPFL, starting from Spring 2022. 

Notebooks require a modern Jupyter Lab or Jupyter Classic installation, with ipywidgets 8. Visualization of atomic structures is achieved using [chemiscope](http://chemiscope.org), that should also be installed separately.
